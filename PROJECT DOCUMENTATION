Course Management System using MERN Stack
1. Abstract
This document describes the Course Management System built using the MERN Stack. It provides
functionality to add, view, and manage course details with a seamless frontend-backend integration.
2. Technologies Used
1. React.js - Frontend User Interface
2. Node.js & Express.js - Backend API Layer
3. MongoDB Memory Server - Temporary In-Memory Database
4. Axios - HTTP Client for connecting frontend and backend
3. Project Objective
The aim of the project is to develop a lightweight course management portal for adding and listing course
information, using modern web technologies. It serves as a hands-on learning experience for working with the
MERN stack.
4. Backend Architecture
The backend is developed using Express.js. It provides two endpoints:
- GET /courses: Fetch all courses
- POST /courses: Add a new course
Data is stored temporarily in memory using MongoDB Memory Server.
5. Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React. It contains a form for course input and a dynamic course list. Axios is used
to handle HTTP requests to the backend.
6. Key Features
- Add new course with title and description
- Display list of all courses
Course Management System using MERN Stack
- State-driven UI updates
- API-driven architecture
7. Dataset
No external dataset was used. All course entries are stored in-memory for testing and demonstration
purposes. The course data includes fields like 'title' and 'description'.
8. Screenshots (Placeholder)
Add screenshots of the frontend form and course list view here.
9. Conclusion
The Course Management System project demonstrates a working full-stack web application using the MERN
architecture. It is self-contained and deployable on any local environment without external database setup.
